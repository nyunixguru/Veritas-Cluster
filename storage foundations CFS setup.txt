Teamed interfaces of vnic 2/VLAN 55 QNS
from david dilworth to All Participants:
do you want to poke around
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I can look, but I'm not supposed to drive.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
u wanted to poke around
from david dilworth to All Participants:
to et the right config
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes. 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
here is the first node
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ems2a
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
If you could cd to /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I would like to look at main.cf
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, so you have the basics configured.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes
from david dilworth to All Participants:
fence
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You have a CFS mount that you want to add?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
I habe a /tibco mount point
from david dilworth to All Participants:
and able to mount the vol on /tibco
from david dilworth to All Participants:
just did it 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, but that is not a CFS, that is just a local filesystem.  Do you want it to be CFS?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes want cfs
from david dilworth to All Participants:
just unmounted
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
So you understand that CFS is mounted at the same time on all nodes?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
on the same mount point /tibco ?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
oK
from david dilworth to All Participants:
new to CFS
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
NP.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
kind of stupid
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Lets use this cfs command to do the work for us.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
what next
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
shoot
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmountadm add tibcodg tibco_VOL /tibco all=cluster
from david dilworth to All Participants:
just gave vxdisk output
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
lets look for it in /opt/VRTS/bin
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Oops.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I spelled it wrong.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmntadm 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cd /opt
from david dilworth to All Participants:
no cigar still
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
ls
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ls
from david dilworth to All Participants:
I dont think its on the system
from david dilworth to All Participants:
locate didnt find it
from david dilworth to All Participants:
what next
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cd VRTS/install
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Hmm, it doesn't appear that you installed sfhacfs6.1
from david dilworth to All Participants:
Ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
should we install it now?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
do you still have the media?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
i s it under here
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
run installer?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It didn't appear that you had to much configured, running the installer will pretty much start over, are you good with that?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
rather not cant we just the cfs piec
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We can see.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It's the last one that is not installed.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
We arent doing RAC ?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Give me a second here.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
it s not oracle
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, good.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
its second from last
from david dilworth to All Participants:
right
from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, pick I
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
5
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
2
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Looks like it's going to do what we need.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok beats reinstalling
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Hit enter
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
n
from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Are you installing this in multiple locations?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
no
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Or just the 2 nodes?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
then say no
from david dilworth to All Participants:
just 2 nodes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Then no is what you want here
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes here?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It depends, I usually don't but it depends on your site.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
wait
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I read that wrong.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes you want to configure this now.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we can configure later
from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
If you want to be safe here
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
we can copy the main.cf 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
do a no
from david dilworth to All Participants:
u dont want to do a -configure?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Well, we need to, but we should copy the main.cf file before we do.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
so know what
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Then we can add back anything you might have changed.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cd /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cp main.cf main.cf.curt
from david dilworth to All Participants:
done
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Now you can run /opt/VRTS/intall/installcfssha.6.1 -configure
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I'm sorry, I typed that from memory...
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cd ../install
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
you had this installed before correct?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
but isnt fencin configured already
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We are re doing the configuration.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We can use all the same disks and stuff.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
say yes?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes, I want to make sure all the CFS stuff is loaded properly.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
you can get all these from the main.cf we saved.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
going now
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Looks good so far.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
configure fencing now?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes we should run the fencing 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
installer.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
2 here?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Do you have disks for fencing?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes
from david dilworth to All Participants:
three
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Then yes, 2 here
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
do a vxdisk -o alldgs list
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Go back to the prompt on the host
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
dmp
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Then we will need to reboot both nodes.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Like the installer asked us to before.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes
from david dilworth to All Participants:
always
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
no
from david dilworth to All Participants:
y here
from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You are not using cordination point server.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
servers so you don't 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Wait.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
you are running in VMware?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Give me a second here.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
did u mess up
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You can't do fencing disks in VMware in certian situations.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
last time i said yes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Let me ask a co worked a question or two.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
for coord point
from david dilworth to All Participants:
Ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we have been doing it all along
from david dilworth to All Participants:
its not going to hurt is it
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
According to my expert here
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
you can only do disk based fencing in a VMware environment
from david dilworth to All Participants:
thats what we did right
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
if each node in your cluster runs on a seperate ESX host.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Otherwise you have to use Coordination Point servers.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It all stems from the systems sharing HBA controllers.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
do we have CP servers? 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
so we cant do disk based fncing?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
No, not if the 2 virtual hosts are on the same VMware server.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we can but the vms on different esci hosts
from david dilworth to All Participants:
right
from david dilworth to All Participants:
they are on different esxi hosts
from david dilworth to All Participants:
now
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes, if you can keep the virtual hosts on different VMware hosts it will work.  If they share the same VMware ESX server it won't work.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
different blades/esxi hosts
from david dilworth to All Participants:
so u think we are good
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, they won't vmotion onto the same host?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
no CP ?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Not unless you set them up.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we can setup an antiaffinity rule
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
OK, just so you realize that.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We are ok.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
to keep thevms separate
from david dilworth to All Participants:
Ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
reboot now?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
eyes.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
youre in Milpitas?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
CA
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Same timezone, I"m in Springfield Oregon.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
Oh
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
lets take a look at your main.cf file.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
oh i see it added a lot by default
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes.  I wanted to make sure that was all there.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
just installing the cfs
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, so what we want to do now, is make our own group and add your mounts to there.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
group vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 ?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we need to add mount?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, just lel me make sure I understand you.  
from david dilworth to All Participants:
here is the config from the old system
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You want a group called vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
group vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 (        SystemList = { ems3 = 0, ems4 = 1 }        AutoFailOver = 0        Parallel = 1        AutoStartList = { ems3, ems4 }        )        CFSMount cfsmount1 (                Critical = 0                MountPoint = "/tibco"                BlockDevice = "/dev/vx/dsk/tibcodg/tibco_VOL"                MountOpt @ems3 = "cluster"                MountOpt @ems4 = "cluster"                NodeList = { ems3, ems4 }                )        CVMVolDg cvmvoldg1 (                Critical = 0                CVMDiskGroup = tibcodg                CVMVolume = { tibco_VOL }                CVMActivation @ems3 = sw                CVMActivation @ems4 = sw                )        requires group cvm online local firm        cfsmount1 requires cvmvoldg1
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we can call it anything
from david dilworth to All Participants:
something more friendly
from david dilworth to All Participants:
but the same concept?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok, we just need to make the group, then use the cfsmntadm command I tried earlier
from david dilworth to All Participants:
OK
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You asked me before how you generate all the commands for building from the command line, so I wanted to show you this little trick.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
u have a one liner ?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
not exactly.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
can we just cut/paste into the main.cf
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We could.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You have to stop VCS for that to work.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok whatever is best?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
what do u have?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
the system you sent me the main.cf from just now, ems3
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Let's create an empty directory over there on that host.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
we can use that?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
made tmp
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
now copy *.cf into that empty directory.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cd into tmp
from david dilworth to All Participants:
done
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
hacf -cftocmd .
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
give me one minute.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
ls
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
look at the main.cmd file
from david dilworth to All Participants:
more main.cmd
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
so that is every command to make everything in main.cf
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok but there is so many
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
If you go find the command that make the group
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Wait
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Wait
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We just need to make the group now.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
hagrp -add groupname
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Wait
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You are scaring me.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
I got the hagrp command to the end of the file
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes, but we can do all that
from david dilworth to All Participants:
I am a guru
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
:-)
from david dilworth to All Participants:

from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
We can do all the mount specifc stuff 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
with the cfsmntadm command
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
we just need the group 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
hagrp -add group_name
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
The other stuff will be done automatically with the cfsmntadm 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
what should I name the group?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I just wanted to show you how you can figure out what commands are needed to build stuff already built on another server.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
CVM_Mount?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It's a big time saver for most stuff.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
No 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Make your own
from david dilworth to All Participants:
cfsmount ?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Make you group.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
This is a mount group?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
The ones that were created by the installer 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
shouldn't have anything else added to them.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
They are for internal VCS use.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
so what do I do here
from david dilworth to All Participants:
haconf -makerw
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes,
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Then hagrp -add group_name
from david dilworth to All Participants:
hagrp -add cfsmount1
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
sure.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
now we should run the cfsmntadm command 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
youre sure
from david dilworth to All Participants:
that will set all the attributes?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmountadm add tibcodg tibco_VOL /tibco all=cluster
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
yes. most of them.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
will it set
from david dilworth to All Participants:
all of this?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
hagrp -modify vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 SystemList  ems3 0 ems4 1hagrp -modify vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 AutoFailOver 0hagrp -modify vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 Parallel 1hagrp -modify vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 AutoStartList  ems3 ems4hagrp -modify vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1 SourceFile "./main.cf"hares -add cfsmount1 CFSMount vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1hares -modify cfsmount1 Critical 0hares -modify cfsmount1 MountPoint "/tibco"hares -modify cfsmount1 BlockDevice "/dev/vx/dsk/tibcodg/tibco_VOL"hares -local cfsmount1 MountOpthares -modify cfsmount1 MountOpt "cluster" -sys ems3hares -modify cfsmount1 MountOpt "cluster" -sys ems4hares -modify cfsmount1 NodeList  ems3 ems4hares -modify cfsmount1 Enabled 1hares -add cvmvoldg1 CVMVolDg vrts_vea_cfs_int_cfsmount1hares -modify cvmvoldg1 Critical 0hares -modify cvmvoldg1 CVMDiskGroup tibcodghares -modify cvmvoldg1 CVMVolume  tibco_VOLhares -local cvmvoldg1 CVMActivationhares -modify cvmvoldg1 CVMActivation
from david dilworth to All Participants:
??
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It might do the critical
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
not do the critical
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You can run those commands if you want to
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
My bad/
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmntadm
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmntadm add tibcodg tibco_VOL /tibco all=cluster
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
ok,
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
that diskgroup 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
has not been imported as shared yet
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
so do this
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
vxdg -s import tibcodg
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Now you have
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
to deport it first.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
it should now be imported on both nodes.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
the vxdg -s  only on one node
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Now that it's been imported as shared
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
It's shared you only have to do the command on one node.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok its good now?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I think so,
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Now we
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
can do the cfscmdadm command
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
cfsmntadm
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I can't type today...
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
done?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
now the main.cf should have that in it.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok
from david dilworth to All Participants:
so we are all good u think?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yep.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
how to manage this
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
If you online the group it should mount
from david dilworth to All Participants:
is it self managing?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
online what group?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
do an hastatus -sum
from david dilworth to All Participants:
do u have command
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
See the group you make vrts_vea
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
...
from david dilworth to All Participants:
hagrp -online?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
yes online that 2 mount
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
hagrp -online vrts_ves_cfs_int_cfsmount1 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I spelled it wrong
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
you might have to a -any
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
at the end
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
hagrp -online vfaf -any
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
No
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
no
from david dilworth to All Participants:
is it good now?
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
That was just to get -any on the end
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I think it's mounted
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
we should chekck
from david dilworth to All Participants:
greta
from david dilworth to All Participants:
great
from david dilworth to All Participants:
its mounted on both nodes
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
You should
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
do an 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
haconf -dump -makero
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
to close the config 
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
That is cool.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
did it fail?
from david dilworth to All Participants:
exit 1
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
No 
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok u sure its good
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
we opened the config, the cfsmntadm must have closed it.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
oh ok
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Just wanted to make sure.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
So that is it for CFS mounts.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
sothats the majority
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I don't know to much about the other application you wanted to add.
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
But you can use the trick I showed you to get all the commands to do that.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
according to them the app doesnt need an agent
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Ok.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
let me compare right quick
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
I can leave this case open for a couple of days so if you have any futher questions you can hit me up.
from david dilworth to All Participants:
ok thanks a lot
from david dilworth to All Participants:
these configs are always drwan out and painful
from Curt Vandetta to All Participants:
Yes, but once done very useful.
